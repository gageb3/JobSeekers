## ⚓ Purpose of This Docs Section

This `/docs` directory is separate from the main README to follow the “dual boot” design:

- **Root README** → BLUF, User Story, Minimum Acceptance Criteria, User-Facing Info  
- **Docs Folder** → Internal Technical Documentation and Developer Resources  
- **Wiki** → Team Process, Roles, Meetings, Product Overview, etc... 
- **GitHub Pages** → Documentation Site Built From This Folder

By separating documentation types, we maintain clarity and keep product-facing and dev-facing information cleanly divided.
