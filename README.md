Project: [Job Application Tracker](https://github.com/gageb3/Recruiters/wiki/Demo-Script)

## USER STORY
**As a** job seeker <br>
**I want to** have a list of jobs I have applied to <br>
**so that I** can keep track of my applications better

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Meet Joe, a job seeker juggling dozens of applications scattered across job boards, emails, and spreadsheets. **JobList** is a web-based job application tracker (**"What"**) built for job seekers managing multiple opportunities at once (**"Who"**). It brings all that chaos into one simple dashboard, helping users stay organized and monitor progress so they never lose track of follow-ups (**"Value"**). By centralizing the job search workflow, **JobList** reduces the time users spend manually managing their applications by **up to 30%**, turning a 10-hour weekly chore into just **7 hours** of orderly progress (**"Primary Metric"**).

## MINIMUM ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, view, update, and delete job applications with key details. Example: Company, Position, status, dates. <br>
- **Authentication:** Secure signup/login with encrypted passwords and JWT tokens. <br>
- **Authorization:** Role-Based Access (Admin) <br>
- **Notifications:** Email reminders for interviews, deadlines, or follow-ups. <br>
- **RESTful API:** Express.js routes handle all CRUD and auth operations. <br>

- **Documentation:** Full README, issues, Wiki, and project board. <br>

## KM (Knowledge Management)
- The Job Tracker App helps users keep all of their job search information in one organized place. It turns scattered notes, emails, and lists into an easy-to-use system where users can see what jobs they have applied for, track updates, and remember follow-ups. <br>
- This will save time by cutting out repetitive tasks like checking multiple sites or retyping the same details. The app helps users stay on top of their job search, avoid missing deadlines, and make better decisions using organized information.
