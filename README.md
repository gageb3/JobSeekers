Project: [Job Application Tracker](https://github.com/gageb3/Recruiters/wiki/Demo-Script)

## USER STORY
As a job seeker<br>
I want to have a list of jobs I have applied to<br>
so that I can keep track of my applications better

## BLUF
**- What:** A web based job application tracker that helps users organize, monitor, and analyze their job search progress in one place. <br>
**- Who:** Designed for job seekers managing multiple applications, interviews, and follow-ups across different platforms. <br>
**- Value:** Simplifies the job hunting process by displaying all job applications that the user has applied for, making the process more organized and optimal for the job searching process. <br>
**- Primary Metric:** Reduces average time users spend manually managing job applications by 30%. <br>
- If a user currently spends 10 hours a week organizing job applications, the app could reduce that to 7 hours a week.

- Authentication: Secure signup/login with encrypted passwords and JWT tokens.
- Authorization: Role-Based Access (Admin)
- Notifications: Email reminders for interviews, deadlines, or follow-ups.
- RESTful API: Express.js routes handle all CRUD and auth operations

## KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

The Job Tracker App helps users keep all of their job search information in one organized place. It turns scattered notes, emails, and lists into an easy-to-use system where users can see what jobs they have applied for, track updates, and remember follow-ups.

Beyond simple record keeping, the app supports **knowledge management** by capturing and organizing key data from each stage of the job search. Users can record company names, positions, dates applied, and the current stage of each application, which turns personal experiences into structured information that can be reviewed and analyzed later.  

By centralizing this information, the app allows users to **identify patterns** such as which types of applications lead to interviews or which deadlines are approaching soon. This helps transform raw data into meaningful insights that support better decision-making.

The app also reduces redundancy by allowing users to update or reference previous entries instead of starting from scratch each time. This ensures that knowledge is **retained, searchable, and reusable**, rather than being lost across different notes or spreadsheets.

In short, the Job Tracker App acts as a **personal knowledge management system** for job hunting, which saves time, improves organization, and helps users make informed choices based on their own collected data.
