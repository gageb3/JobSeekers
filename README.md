## USER STORY
**As a** job seeker <br>
**I want to** have a list of jobs I have applied to <br>
**so that I** can keep track of my applications better

## BLUF
Meet Joe, a job seeker who’s applied to dozens of positions scattered across job boards, emails, and spreadsheets. **J*bList** brings all of that chaos into one simple web app, helping users to organize/monitor, and follow up on every application from a single dashboard. Designed for busy job seekers juggling multiple opportunities, it streamlines the job search process and reduces the time spent manually tracking applications by up to **30%**. Turning a 10-hour weekly chore into just 7 hours of organized progress.

## KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

The Job Tracker App helps users keep all of their job search information in one organized place. It turns scattered notes, emails, and lists into an easy-to-use system where users can see what jobs they have applied for, track updates, and remember follow-ups.

Beyond simple record keeping, the app supports **knowledge management** by capturing and organizing key data from each stage of the job search. Users can record company names, positions, dates applied, and the current stage of each application, which turns personal experiences into structured information that can be reviewed and analyzed later.  

By centralizing this information, the app allows users to **identify patterns** such as which types of applications lead to interviews or which deadlines are approaching soon. This helps transform raw data into meaningful insights that support better decision-making.

The app also reduces redundancy by allowing users to update or reference previous entries instead of starting from scratch each time. This ensures that knowledge is **retained, searchable, and reusable**, rather than being lost across different notes or spreadsheets.

In short, the Job Tracker App acts as a **personal knowledge management system** for job hunting, which saves time, improves organization, and helps users make informed choices based on their own collected data.
