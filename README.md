## USER STORY

## BLUF
Meet Joe, a job seeker who’s applied to dozens of positions scattered across job boards, emails, and spreadsheets. **J*bList** brings all of that chaos into one simple web app, helping users to organize/monitor, and follow up on every application from a single dashboard. Designed for busy job seekers juggling multiple opportunities, it streamlines the job search process and reduces the time spent manually tracking applications by up to **30%**. Turning a 10-hour weekly chore into just 7 hours of organized progress.
